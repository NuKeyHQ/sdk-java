Volta SDK for Java

## Contracts
Java bindings to Volta contracts and other contracts are stored in the `contracts` directory. The bindings are generated
using [web3j-cli](https://docs.web3j.io/4.8.7/command_line_tools/) from the contract ABI JSON files, generated by the
solidity compiler (or from forge's output).

To add or modify a contract, first generate the ABI JSON file and place it in the `contracts` directory. Then, run
the following commands to generate the Go bindings:
```bash
web3j generate solidity -a contracts/VoltaFactory.json -o src/main/java -p xyz.voltawallet.contracts
```
